                        VePay offers ethical and Shariah-compliant funding solutions for eCommerce sellers through its
                        proprietary platform, collectively referred to as the "Service." The Service includes features
                        such as invoice factoring, real-time marketplace data integration, and a client portal for
                        tracking balances, withdrawals, and funding activity.

                        Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms of Service, as well as any additional terms,

                        There is no cost to maintain your VePay account. However, certain Services offered by VePay may
                        require the payment of fees and other amounts. For example, Lending Services are subject to
                        separate Financing Agreements that you must enter into before participating in such Services and
                        receiving any financings from the Company's affiliates. Additionally, other Services offered by
                        VePay may require one-time payments, ongoing subscription payments, or other types of payments
                        in order to access and use them.

                    <p>
                        Your right to access and use the VePay website and Services is personal to you and may not be
                        transferred to any other person or entity. You may only access and use the VePay website and
                        Services for lawful and proper purposes. <br/>
                        In order to provide certain Services, VePay may need to verify your identity. By using the
                        Services, you authorize VePay to conduct inquiries and due diligence on you and your business,
                        which may include requesting additional information, validating your identity, and connecting
                        with necessary Ecommerce Providers. If you fail to provide the requested information or if VePay
                        cannot verify your identity to its satisfaction, VePay may refuse to allow you to use the
                        Services.<br/>
                        Please note that the Services and financings provided by VePay are intended for business
                        purposes only. By using the Services and receiving financings from the Company's affiliates, you
                        represent, warrant, and covenant that all financing proceeds are used exclusively for business
                        purposes. You further acknowledge that the Services do not involve consumer credit and that the
                        statutory and regulatory protections for consumers do not apply to you in relation to the
                        Services or any financing provided by VePay's affiliates.<br/>
                        VePay strongly advises you to seek counsel from a competent attorney and accountant to ensure
                        that the Services and the financing products offered by VePay's affiliates meet your business
                        needs and that you understand and can fulfill the obligations associated with them. VePay
                        recommends seeking legal and accounting advice before entering into any Financing Agreements.

                        the Service to be compatible with the third-party sites for which you provide information. VePay

                        from third-party sites and Ecommerce Providers. The Services are not sponsored or endorsed by
