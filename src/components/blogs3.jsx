        <h2 className="article-subtitle">Key Algorithms Powering Amazon</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Relevance Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          This algorithm is used to determine the relevance of a product to a particular search query. 
          When a customer searches for a product on Amazon, the relevance algorithm helps to determine 
          which products are the most relevant and should be shown first in the search results.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Best Sellers Rank (BSR) Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          This algorithm is used to rank products based on their sales and popularity. The BSR is displayed 
          on product detail pages and is used to help buyers find the most popular products in a particular category.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Conversion Rate Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          This algorithm is used to predict the likelihood that a customer will purchase a product based 
          on their browsing and purchase history, as well as other factors. The conversion rate algorithm 
          helps Amazon decide which products to show to which customers in order to increase the likelihood of a sale.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Product Recommendation Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          This algorithm is used to recommend products to customers based on their past purchases and 
          browsing history. Amazon uses this algorithm to show personalized product recommendations to 
          customers on its website and through its email and advertising campaigns.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Fraud Detection Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          This algorithm is used to detect and prevent fraudulent activity on Amazon's platform. 
          It analyzes various data points to identify suspicious activity and help protect both buyers and sellers.
